# Chess-Pieces-Position-Prediction_using_FEN
Developed a predictive model using the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks to classify chess piece positions using Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) with the objective of enabling more effective analysis of chess positions. Utilized Kaggle's Chess Positions dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koryakinp/chess-positions) and implemented several key steps in the data processing pipeline, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), feature engineering, and encoding/decoding of the FEN labels. Lastly, Conducted a comprehensive model assessment using metrics such as F1 Score and accuracy, ensuring precise and reliable predictions of chess positions.
