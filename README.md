# Chess-Pieces-Position-Prediction_using_FEN
Leveraged Keras and TensorFlow to develop a machine learning model for classifying and analyzing chess board positions using Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN); implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Engineered custom functions for image-to-grid conversion, and one-hot encoding/decoding, and created data generators to dynamically load and preprocess data for model training and prediction.
Conducted rigorous model evaluation using metrics such as F1-score and accuracy, achieving high prediction accuracy, thereby enabling more effective analysis of chess positions.
